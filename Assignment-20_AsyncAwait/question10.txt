 10). In which scenarios would you use synchronous code instead of asynchronous code?

ans:

Synchronous programming is a better fit for Sequential tasks, where stopping the entire program to wait for a network request or disk IO makes sense.
Synchronous programming is by far the simplest and easier.

Use synchronous programming when your project focuses on a single task or tasks that are highly dependent and cannot run in parallel.
 eg:Web Pages,Video Rendering.
