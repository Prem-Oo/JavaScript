1). How does async/await help with performance and scalability?

Async/Await is used to work with promises in asynchronous functions. It is basically syntactic sugar for promises. 
It is just a wrapper to restyle code and make promises easier to read and use.
It makes asynchronous code look more like synchronous/procedural code, which is easier to understand. 
Async and await allows you to wrap your code using a try and catch to handle errors.
