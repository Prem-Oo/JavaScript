// 9). What is the best way to avoid deadlocks when using async/await?

A deadlock is a condition where a process is unable to continue because it is waiting for an event that will never happen.
In JavaScript, this can happen when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a lock.

Thread deadlock occurs when multiple threads require the same locks but are not in sync in order to access them.
Deadlock can be avoided by eliminating all four required conditions: mutual exclusion, hold and wait, no preemption, and circular wait.
